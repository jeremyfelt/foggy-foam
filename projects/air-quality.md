# Air quality

It'd be cool to have some PM2.5 air quality sensors in or around the house, especially during fire season. Every year I poke at commercially available products, but always want (a) something that I can grab data from easily over the network, but (b) something that doesn't phone home or only phones home to something I trustâ€”effectively nothing.

I have a [personal Pullman air quality](https://air.jeremyfelt.com) site up that reads the latest data from one of the nearby public air quality sensors. Anything I do with DIY sensors could be added to that page.
