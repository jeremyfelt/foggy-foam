# Air quality

It'd be cool to have some PM2.5 air quality sensors in or around the house, especially during fire season. Every year I poke at commercially available products, but always want (a) something that I can grab data from easily over the network, but (b) something that doesn't phone home or only phones home to something I trustâ€”effectively nothing.

I have a [personal Pullman air quality](https://air.jeremyfelt.com) site up that reads the latest data from one of the nearby public air quality sensors. Anything I do with DIY sensors could be added to that page.

## DIY Possibilities

* [AirGradient DIY Air Quality Sensor](https://www.airgradient.com/diy/)
* [CanAirIO](https://github.com/kike-canaries)
* [Build a low cost air quality sensor with CanAirIO](https://www.hackster.io/canairio/build-a-low-cost-air-quality-sensor-with-canairio-bbf647)

## Inspiration

It'd be cool if a final answer did something close to these but without relying on a central service or proprietary nonsense.

* The [Kaiterra Laser egg](https://www.kaiterra.com/en/laser-egg-co2/) is Wirecutter's top pick.
