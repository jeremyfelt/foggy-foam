# Foggy Garden

This is the garden's home. I also have a [regular website](https://jeremyfelt.com).

Some things are public:

* [Projects](/projects/)
* [Garden meta](meta)
* [Setting up a new Ubuntu server](new-server)
* [Watch list](watching)

Others are not:

* An [[inbox]] of ideas.
* Drafts of [a weekly note](/journal/weekly/)
* [Personal notes](/personal/)
* [Happy Prime notes](/happy-prime/)

More to come! I'm still figuring this out!
