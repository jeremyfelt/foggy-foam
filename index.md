# Foggy Garden

This is the garden's home. I also have a [regular website](https://jeremyfelt.com).

Public entry points:
* [[projects]]
* [Garden meta](meta)
* [Setting up a new Ubuntu server](new-server)

Private entry points are not publicly accessible:
* An [[inbox]] of ideas, accessible locally.
* [Personal notes](personal/index.md)
* [Happy Prime notes](happy-prime/index.md) are not publicly accessible.
* (And those links don't really even work locally with my Eleventy config)

More to come! I'm still figuring this out!
