# Watched and watching in 2021

## TV Series

### Current

* [Mare of Easttown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_of_Easttown), HBO, season 1
* [Halston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halston_(miniseries)), Netflix, season 1
* [Peaky Blinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)), Netflix, season 5
* [Black Spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_(TV_series)), Netflix, season 1
  * Started on May 18, 2021
  * It's amusing the French title is Zone Blanche, or White Zone, and that was somehow translated into Black Spot for Netlfix in the US.

### Waiting for

*Nothing at the moment*

### Finished

* [Borgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgen_(TV_series)), Netflix
  * I first watched season 1 in 2011 for free on IMDB.
  * We watched part of season 1 together a few years ago.
  * Finally rewatched and finished the entire series in early 2021.
  * It really fell off after the first season, which was fantastic.
* [The Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Investigation_(TV_series)), HBO
  * We did not find out this was based on a true story until after we finished.
  * Fun to see [Pilou Asbæk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilou_Asb%C3%A6k) and [Søren Malling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Malling) in a show together so soon after we finished Borgen.

### Bailed

* [Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_(TV_series)), HBO, after 2 episodes
  * It has it's moments, but feels a bit tropey and wasn't enough to keep us engaged.

## Movies

### Watched

* May 21, 2021: [Willy's Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy's_Wonderland)
  * Should be recut to only scenes of Nick Cage cleaning and playing pinball.
